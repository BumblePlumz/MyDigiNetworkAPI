  description: |-
    This is a sample Student Social Network Server based on the OpenAPI 3.0 specification. In this version of the student social network API, we've switched to a design-first approach, ensuring that the API is well-documented and easy to improve collaboratively.

    You can now contribute to this API by suggesting changes to the API definition itself or by modifying the underlying codebase. This collaborative approach allows us to enhance the API continuously, making it easier for students to connect, collaborate, and share resources in a secure and efficient environment.
